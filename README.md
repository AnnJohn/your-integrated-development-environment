# Using the Learn IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

The Learn Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is what you'll be using to write code and submit your labs on Learn. Let's take a closer look at what it is and how it works. 

We created the Learn IDE based off of the very popular Atom text editor (which was created by GitHub). Atom was designed to be highly configurable, and so we've configured it to be optimized for writing code and solving labs with Learn in two important ways: (1) we've added a shell that is connected to a server in the cloud which is configured with all of the tools and packages required to build software, and given you access to that server via a Terminal window within the app and (2) all of the files you're working on for your code labs are actually saved on that cloud-based server. 

So you can think of the Learn IDE as a powerful text editor that gives you handy access to a fully-equipped development environment in the cloud. And since you're connected to that server in the cloud, the files and folder you're able to see in the Learn IDE are those that exist on that server, rather than the files on your computer. That may sound confusing, but you'll seeâ€”in practice, you'll have access to all of the files you need for Learn and it will feel very natural.

## What are the Components of the IDE? 

Let's spend a minute studying the Learn IDE user interface. You'll notice that it's composed of three sections: (1) a file browser (2) a text editor and (3) the console which you'll see in the image below.

### IDE File Browser

The left side of your IDE application houses a simple file browser. It works just like a file browser on any computer: you can navigate a tree of folders and files to find the file you're looking for. Opening a file will open its contents in the text editor on the right. This is often the most convenient to see the structure of a file tree and find a file quickly.

Reminder: the files you can see and access here are those that exist on the server you're connected to with the Learn IDE, not those on your local computer. 

### IDE Text Editor

The text editor is the heart of the IDE. It's where you'll write code, and where you'll be spending most of your time. Again, we built the IDE on top of Atom, a free open-source text editor by GitHub. One of the nifty things about text editors that have been optimized for programming is that your code will highlight as you type in ways that make it easier to discern the structure of your program. You'll notice this when you start writing your own code.  

When you click on a file in your file browser, it will open up in the text editor portion of the IDE and you can go ahead and edit right there. 

### IDE Terminal

While the upper part of the screen is where you write code, the lower part of the screen is the terminal where you'll be typing in commands to navigate files and folders. 

Reminder: again, just like the file tree on the left, this terminal gives you access to the files and folders on our server, and not the files and folders on your local computer. 

We'll soon cover how to enter commands into the console that will allow you open, test and submit code with Learn.

## Important note about connectivity

You need an Internet connection in order to use the Learn IDE. You can edit code in your text editor when you're offline, but you will only be able to save it when re-establish a connection. 

Hint: If you the word "Learn" in green letters below your Terminal, you're connected.
